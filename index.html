    <h2> Alex Lima</h2>
    <p> Hello guys! I'm Alex and I'm 24 years old and I'm from Brazil. I've been studying at BYU-I for about 1 year and a half, but this semester is my first semester as a Computer Science Major</p>
    <p> A few facts about me: As previously stated, I am from Brazil, therefore my first language is Portuguese, but I also speak English, Spanish, and French. I've always been fascinated by different cultures and how we are able to interact with people through language, so I think this is really fascinating.</p>
    <p> There are numerous things I enjoy doing as a BYU-I student because I study here. Particularly important are the connections we form and the opportunity we have to gain knowledge from one another. This class is an example of it. For my first experience with making a website, this has been a lot of fun thus far, and I really hope that this will be something I can work with in the future.</p>
     <p> I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my entire life, and there's a lot we can learn from the church's leaders. The most recent one that comes to mind is President Nelson's appeal to each of us to endeavor to be peacemakers, which was very meaningful to me.</p> 
     <p> That's a little bit of who I am.</p>
